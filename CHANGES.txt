Version Beta 1.1: The Shader Update!

    Uhh... I've just now added this little changelog.

    Main Features:
        Added shader support!
    Other Features:
        Added this line of text when you forget to type a filename: "Or you could type "codeframework --info" for more info"
    

    Why do I have this changelog? No idea.
