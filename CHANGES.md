## Version Beta 1.1: The Shader Update!

Uhh... I've just now added this little changelog.

### Main Features
- Added shader support!
- Added the `LoadShader` function.
- Added the `SetShader` function.
### Other Features
- Added this line of text when you forget to type a filename: "Or you could type "codeframework--info" for more info"
    

Why do I have this changelog? No idea.

## Version Beta 1.2: The Unloading Update!

Memory leaks... they're not fun.

### Main Features
- Added the `UnloadSound` function.
- Added the `UnloadSprite` function.
- Added the `UnloadShader` function.

## Version Beta 1.3: The Font Update!

I noticed that currently you can only use the raylib font. Some like it, but others would like more.

I've also thought, "Love 2D has that no game screen, why can't I?", so I added one.

### Main Features
- Added the `LoadFont` function.
- Added the `SetFont` function.
- Added the `ResetFont` function.
## Other Features
- Added the "No File" screen.

## Version beta 1.4: The Input Update!

Life (for non vim users) is dull and boring without the mouse.

Life is also (for everyone, including vim users) dull and boring with just four keys, so here we are.

I've added three new functions! All for mouse input. And while we're on the topic of input, why not add some keys?

### Main Features
- Added the `GetMousePosition` function.
- Added the `IsMouseButtonDown` function.
- Added the `IsMouseButtonPressed` function.
- Added the enter key as an option for `IsKeyDown`.
- Added the space key as an option for `IsKeyDown`.
